									<b>Research Story</b> <br>
									When I started Mini-Challenge 3 at the Apple Developer Academy, mentors asked every student about topics we were most interested in. 
									After that, the mentors grouped us into small groups according to the topics that we chose. <br>
									At that time, I chose mental health as a topic. The reason I chose this topic was that some of my close friends had mental health problems, 
									and it had very bad impacts on their health and social life. Because of that, 
									I always think that mental health problems are serious problems and unfortunately people rarely care about these issues. <br>
									In this project, I worked as an iOS engineer and also as a UX researcher. 
									At the initial stage, we tried to refine the big idea about mental health issues we wanted to solve. 
									We made as many guiding questions as possible and tried to answer them one by one through desk research and interviews with a psychologist. 
									After going through the research process, we got one main problem that we wanted to solve, which is excessive worrying.
									We got information that most of the anxiety sufferers in Indonesia (which are mostly dominated by young people) feel excessive worry symptoms just before the attack. 
									We also ask our guiding expert, Ms. Zahra Intani, the psychologist from Kindehutte Indonesia, 
									whether there is anything that can be done to relieve symptoms of excessive anxiety in anxiety sufferers. 
									Ms. Zahra explained that there is a method, called <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/grounding-techniques.pdf">grounding technique method,</a>
									that can relieve excessive worrying in anxiety sufferers by using their senses so that they can return to the present moment. <br>
								</p>
								<p>									
									<b>Technical Story</b> <br>
									We created this project using SwiftUI because we wanted to learn the latest framework from Apple. The use of SwiftUI in this project greatly cut development time because SwiftUI can easily adjust the auto layout for all iOS screen sizes. <br>
									As an iOS engineer, I got the task to created an audio recording system, storage system, and audio playback system. I use AVFoundation then save the recorded audio to the iPhone directory using a simple user default. Audio will be stored with a unique code using the date and time of the record session that has been converted into a string.
									After the audio is stored, then our app will fetch those stored audios in Journal View Controller via the saved URL. <br>
									The fetch process will search for an audio folder that has been scrambled by the sandbox in the iPhone local directory, the fetched audio files then will be displayed in table view format for subsequent play. Users are also allowed to delete the audio they want to delete. <br>
